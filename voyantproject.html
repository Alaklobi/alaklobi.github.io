Charles Dickens is one of the greatest English novelists from the Victorian era. Before he became famous for his writing, he suffered a lot. For example, he did not complete his education; he had to leave school at an early age because he was the eldest of eight brothers when his father was imprisoned for debt. For my Voyant visualization project, I chose four of his novels: The Pickwick Papers (1837), Nicholas Nickleby (1839), David Copperfield (1850), and Bleak House (1853). The goal of this project is to analyze these novels to find out how much they were influenced by Dickens’s social experiences.<br> 

Before uploading the four text files to Voyant, I arranged the files by date and cleaned them to have 1,342,473 words total.<br>

I started searching by using the terms tool for seventeen words related to social relationships, as seen in figure 1. I noticed that the words repeat in varying numbers in the texts. I also noticed that the words that would create a good social life—friend, love, and family—repeat often in the texts, whereas the words that imply negative or harmful social relationships—alone, enemy, and hate—repeat much less frequently. <br>

	Therefore, I decided to use the trend tool to compare the occurrence of these words across the four novels. As shown in figure 2 below, the words that relate to positive aspects of life repeat across all the novels more often than the words that relate to negative aspects of life do. <br>

	Next, to find out which novels contain the highest number of references to the positive aspects of life, I used the Mandala tool. As shown in figure 3, Nicholas Nickleby contains the largest number of these words overall, while The Pickwick Papers contains the most uses of friendship, friend, and home. David Copperfield and Bleak House contain more uses of the words of home, love, and kind than the other novels do.<br>

		To conclude, by using Voyant to analyze The Pickwick Papers (1837), Nicholas Nickleby (1839), David Copperfield (1850), and Bleak House (1853) by Charles Dickens, I found that these novels contain many terms related to both positive and negative aspects of social relationships, including family, love, friendship, kindness, and hostility. This proves that these aspects of the novelist’s life had an impact on his writings.<br>
