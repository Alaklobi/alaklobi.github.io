	    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Saied Ayied Alaklobi; I’m currently a doctoral student in curriculum and instruction at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I have a bachelor’s degree in computer education and a master’s degree in computer and information science in applied computer science.<br> 
During my undergraduate studies, I took full advantage of courses that provided a conceptual comprehension of computer education and introduced me to advanced computer techniques and computational tools for analysis. These courses and the additional research in which I engaged improved my critical thinking skills and prepared me for my master’s degree. The conceptual understanding I developed as an undergraduate has been instrumental not only in my own learning process, but also in explaining complicated concepts to others. <br>
After earning my bachelor’s degree, I worked for two years (2009-2011) as the secretary for Al-Yasrah Operating–Maintenance at King Faisal University in Dammam and for the Al-Faisal Company’s electronic and mechanical operations in Dammam. Then I worked for Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education for one year as a computer teacher at a middle school in the Najran Province before receiving the opportunity to pursue a master’s degree in the United States. <br>
My first step was studying English at Ohio University. After one year, I enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer and Information Science program at Gannon University in Erie, Pennsylvania. Gannon offers the most organized and developed computer science system in the United States, and this program enabled me to gain new expertise in my area of interest. I completed the program with 4.0 GPA. While attending Gannon University, I also demonstrated leadership skills by collaborating with others on class projects. <br>
Pursuing a master’s degree taught me that problem solving is a stimulating experience. Through various projects, I came to realize that I want a career in research. I would be honored to have the opportunity to make significant contributions to computer science when I return home to work for the Ministry of Education as a middle school computer teacher in the Medina Province.<br> 
I am a goal-oriented person; I define my objectives and work toward their completion. I never give up, and I work extremely hard to accomplish my goals. I have had to overcome many barriers and obstacles as a foreigner pursuing my education in the United States. These challenges have made me more determined as a doctoral student. My goal is to receive the best education possible so that I can be an excellent professor in my homeland. <br>
Currently, I am embracing the challenge of earning my DED degree at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in Curriculum and Instruction program. My primary purpose for earning a doctoral degree in curriculum and instruction from such a prestigious university is that I want to develop my knowledge and professional skills to improve my career as a teacher.
